  This is my very first graphical project using the MLX42 library. The goal is to create a simple 2D topdown game in C (imagine Bomberman or Pacman but a super budgeted version).
Through this project, I was introduced to the basic of window management, event handling, textures/images handling and introducing testing and checks early on of the project.
The school that I am at, Hive Helsinki, allows us to use MLX42 instead of MinilibX.
