  This is my very first graphical project using the MLX42 library. The goal is to create a simple 2D topdown game in C (imagine Bomberman or Pacman but a super budgeted version).
Through this project, I was introduced to the basic of window management, event handling, textures/images handling and introducing testing and checks early on of the project.
The school that I am at, Hive Helsinki, allows us to use MLX42 instead of MinilibX.

<h3>The Game</h3>

The project states that the player's goal is to collect all the chest and then enter the exit. The exit shouldn't open before all the chests are collected. 

• The player is moved by `W, A, S, and D` keys (you can choose ZQSD if you prefer)
• The player should be able to move in four directions: up, down, left and right.
• The player can't walk into the walls or the exit before all the chests are collected.
• The number of the player's movement should be recorded and display in the shell.
